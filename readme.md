# Are You Sure?

#### Simple WordPress plugin that adds confirmation dialogue to the Publish button.

Sometimes you accidentally publish a post or a page on your WordPress that was not intended to go live. Accidental Publishing can be (not in all cases) a problem if you have automated the publishing process further, such as sharing the post to Facebook, Twitter, IFTT or maybe even content sent to email subscribers.

With this plugin, such problems can be avoided!
